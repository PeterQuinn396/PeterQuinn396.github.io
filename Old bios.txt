2015-2019

My name is Peter Quinn. I study Honours Electrical Engineering at McGill University. 
This is my website, where I keep a portfolio of projects that I've worked on and things
that I've done. 

I've been a student at McGill university since Fall 2015, and I am due to graduate in Winter of 2019.
I chose to study electrical engineering because I have always enjoyed working with and 
learning about math, physics, and computers. The electrical engineering program at McGill combines all of those
subjects. I opted for the honours program since it will allow me to do a thesis research project as my capstone project. 
I plan to pursue graduate studies after my undergrad so this seemed like a good opportunity to learn and gain 
experience in a research setting early, in addtion to the research internships I have done.
